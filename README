I. Adding the ../sources/meta-imx-scfw layer to your build
==========================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer ../sources/meta-imx-scfw'


II. Getting imx-sc-firmware sources and deploy them in the right location
=========================================================================

This layer is based on the imx-sc-firmware sources that are provided with the imx-sc-firmware porting kit
available for download (check under Linux section) at:

Link: https://www.nxp.com/imxsw

Note that the porting kit needs special licenses to be accepted before downloading.

Steps:
 1. Download the poring kit archive.
 2. Extract porting kit archive.
 3. Run binary in the packages/ directory & accept EULA.
 4. Copy needed imx-scfw-porting-kit-[version]/src/scfw_export_mx8*.tar.gz to the meta-imx-scfw layer:
    meta-imx-scfw/recipes-bsp/imx-sc-firmware/imx-sc-firmware/ 
 5. Rename your imx-sc-firmware patch to scfw.patch and copy it to the meta-imx-scfw layer.
    Use the same location used for (4).


III. Setting correct build parameters for the imx-sc-firmware recipe
====================================================================

In order to have a working build please set SILICON_REVISION and BOARD_TYPE variables to match the sources from (II.4)
Also the path correct path to the imx-scfw-toolchain needs to be added.
This can be done in the imx-sc-firmware recipe through the TOOLS variable within the compile task.
